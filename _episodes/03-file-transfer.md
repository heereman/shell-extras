There are other ways to interact with remote files other than git.

It is true that we can clone an entire git repository, or even one level of a git repository using:
`git clone --depth-1 repository_name`.
What about files that do not exist in a git repository? If we wish to download files from the shell
we can use tools such as Wget, cURL, and lftp.

## Wget

Wget is a simple tool developed for the GNU Project that downloads files with the HTTP, HTTPS and FTP protocols. It is widely used by Unix-like users and is available with most Linux distributions.

To download this lesson (located at http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-extras/03-file-transfer.html) from the web via HTTP we can simply type:

~~~
$ wget http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-extras/03-file-transfer.html
~~~
{: .bash}

{: .output}

Alternatively, you can add more options, which are in the form:

~~~
wget -r -np -D domain_name target_URL
~~~
{: .bash}

where `-r` means recursively crawl to other files and directories, `-np` means avoid crawling to parent directories, and `-D` means to target only the following domain name

For our URL it would be:

~~~
$ wget -r -np -D software-carpentry.org http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-extras/03-file-transfer.html
~~~
{: .bash}

To restrict retrieval to a particular extension(s)
we can use the `-A` option followed by a comma separated list:

~~~
wget -r -np -D software-carpentry.org -A html http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-extras/03-file-transfer.html
~~~
{: .bash}

We can also clone a webpage with its local dependencies:

~~~
$ wget -mkq target_URL
~~~
{: .bash}

We could also clone the entire website:

~~~
$ wget -mkq -np -D domain_name domain_name_URL
~~~
{: .bash}

and add the `-nH` option if we do not want a subdirectory created for the websites content:

e.g.

~~~
$ wget -mkq -np -nH -D example.com http://example.com
~~~
{: .bash}

where:

`-m` is for mirroring with time stamping, infinite recursion depth, and preservation of FTP directory settings
`-k` converts links to make them suitable for local viewing 
`-q` supresses the output to the screen

The above command can also save the clone the contents of one domain to another
if we are using ssh or sshfs to access a webserver. 
 
Please refer to the man page by typing `man wget` in the shell for more information.
  
## cURL

Alternatively, we can use `cURL`.
It supports a much larger range of protocols including common mail based protocols like pop3 and smtp. 

To download this lesson (located at http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-extras/03-file-transfer.html)
from the web via HTTP we can simply type:

~~~
$ curl -o 10-file_transfer.html http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-extras/03-file-transfer.html
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                   Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100 14005  100 14005    0     0  35170      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  105k
~~~
{: .output}

This input to curl is in the form:

~~~
curl -o filename_for_local_machine target_url
~~~
{: .bash}

where the `-o` option says write the output to a file instead of the stdout (the screen),
and file_name_for_local_machine is any file name you choose to save to the local machine,
and target_URL is where the file is the URL where the file is on the web

Removing the `-o` option, and following the syntax `curl target_URL`
outputs the contents of the url to the screen.
If we wanted to enhance the functionality we have we could use information from the pipes and filters section,
which is lesson 4 from the unix shell session.

For example, we could type
`curl http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-extras/03-file-transfer.html | grep curl`
which would tell us that indeed this URL contains the string curl.
We could make the output cleaner by limiting the output of curl to just the file contents by using the `-s` option
(e.g. `curl -s http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-extras/03-file-transfer.html | grep curl`). 

If we wanted only the text and not the html tags in our output we could use html to text parser such as `html2text`.

~~~
$ curl -s http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-extras/03-file-transfer.html | html2text | grep curl
~~~
{: .bash}

With `wget`, we can obtain the same results by typing:

~~~
$ wget -q -D swcarpentry.github.io -O /dev/stdout http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-extras/03-file-transfer.html | html2text | grep curl
~~~
{: .bash}

`Wget` offers more functionality natively than `curl` for retrieving entire directories.
We could use `Wget` to first retrieve an entire directory and then run `html2text` and `grep`
to find a particular string.
`cURL` is limited to retrieving one or more specified URLs that cannot be obtained by recursively crawling a directory.
The situation may be improved by combining with other unix tools, but is not thought as being as good as `Wget`.

Please refer to the man pages by typing `man wget`, `man curl`, and `man html2text` in the shell for more information. 

## lftp

Another option is `lftp`. It has a lot of capability, and even does simple bitorrent. 

If we want to retrieve `03-file-transfer.html` on the website and save it with the filename `03-file-transfer.html` locally:

~~~
$ lftp -c get http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-extras/03-file-transfer.html
~~~
{: .bash}

If we want to print `03-file-transfer.html` to the screen instead:

~~~
$ lftp -c cat http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-extras/03-file-transfer.html
~~~
{: .bash}

To obtain retrive all of the files with a particular extension in a directory we can type:

~~~
$ lftp -c mget {URL for directory}/*.extension_name
~~~
{: .bash}

For example, to retrieve all of the `.html` files in the extras folder:

~~~
$ lftp -c mget http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-extras/*.html
~~~
{: .bash}

Please refer to the man page by typing `man lftp` in the shell for more information.

> 1. Display the version of Wget.

>
> > ## Solution
> > 1. No: -V shows the version
> > 2. No: -b takes you to background immediately after startup. 
> > 3. No: -q turns of Wget's output, stands for 'quiet'
> > 4. No: -v turns on verbose output, with all the available data.
> > 5. Yes: -c Continue getting a partially-downloaded file. This is useful when you want to finish up a download started by a previous instance of Wget, or by another program.  For instance: wget -c ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z. If there is a file named ls-lR.Z in the current directory, Wget will assume that it is the first portion of the remote file, and will ask the server to continue the retrieval from an offset equal to the length of the local file.
